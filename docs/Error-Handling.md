# Minimizing duplicates in sequences

1. If duplicate steps are processed for a sequence, if any of the steps match the pre-requisite condition, the sequence will continue with a warning.

2. When saving a step in a sequence, if the logic block results in the creation of a step that pre-exists in the template, do not create a subsequent step.
